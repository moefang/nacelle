{"body":"Nacelle Microframework\r\n======================\r\n\r\nNacelle is a simple python microframework for Google Appengine designed to stay out of your way and let you get to the fun stuff as quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nWebapp2 is awesome, but doesn't quite do enough and you usually end up spending substantial time building scaffolding.  Django's fantastic but sometimes feels like it tries to do too much and has gotten too heavy for my typical use case.  Nacelle's designed to fill this gap, all the beauty and simplicity of webapp2 with a heavy dose of inspiration from Django.\r\n\r\nNacelle includes the following libraries (see lib folder for license details):\r\n\r\n    - Jinja2 for templating support\r\n    - WTForms for djangoforms style forms support\r\n    - Markdown for markdown parsing support\r\n    - simplejson for json parsing/encoding\r\n    - unidecode for extra unicode support\r\n    - raven for support for reporting errors to a sentry server\r\n\r\nOne of the main goals of Nacelle is to encourage code reuse by enabling pluggable apps that can be reused across multiple projects.  Nacelle makes very few assumptions about your code and only requires that you do one or two things to use it.\r\n\r\nNacelle includes some extra features (for which I'll add documentation later) like base models and handlers which incorporate full version control.  And some convenient decorators to allow for things like derived properties on your models and automatic retries on Exception.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
